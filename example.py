""" This example shows how to extract features for a new signature, 
    using the CNN trained on the GPDS dataset [1]. It also compares the
    results with the ones obtained by the authors, to ensure consistency.

    Note that loading and compiling the model takes time. It is preferable
    to load and process multiple signatures in the same python session.
